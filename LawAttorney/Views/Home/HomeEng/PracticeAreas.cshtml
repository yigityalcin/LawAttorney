                                Compensation law, one of the fundamental and most frequently invoked branches of current legal regulations, is also one of the most litigated areas of law. It encompasses compensation for medical malpractice, traffic accidents, damages caused by the fault of the administration, as well as compensation for acts constituting crimes and many other situations. Compensation law regulates the legal processes related to the compensation of damages suffered by individuals or organizations. Compensation claims are usually made for the purpose of compensating for material or moral damages.

                                Criminal law, one of the main branches of law, is a special field that requires meticulous work as it involves the restriction of individuals' freedoms. Additionally, victim representation, also known as complainant representation, forms another aspect of criminal proceedings. It is worth noting that some crimes defined by law are subject to reconciliation before filing a lawsuit. Representation during the reconciliation stage benefits both parties.

These branches represent areas that require specialized knowledge, separate from other areas of law, and can only be successfully handled by competent practitioners.

                                Processes in this area of law, which involves clients' personal and private lives, should be conducted with confidentiality and in high cooperation. Divorce law, a subset of family law, is the most significant part of this broad field. Divorce cases can be contested or take the form of uncontested divorce. Custody, alimony, marital property regime, material compensation, and moral damages, also known as compensation for suffering, are other main topics of disputes.

                                Compensation items such as severance pay, notice pay, and overtime pay, which are the rightful rewards for workers' hard work, give life to numerous disputes before the courts. For the employee, the collection of these compensations is of vital importance, while from the employer's perspective, preventing overpayment of labor receivables with proper legal support is a critical legal service.

                                It is important to note that, in labor receivables, the mandatory mediation stage defined by law must be completed before the lawsuit stage, and not only the lawsuit stage but also the entire process, including the mediation stage, provides significant advantages when followed with a lawyer.
